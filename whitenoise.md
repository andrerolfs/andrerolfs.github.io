My idea is to have a view in small web service which is reloaded if a get request from client side sees a change in the data. This way I can have a timed get request loading only a true/false and if true comes the whole view is updated.

* [Angular vs JQuery](https://www.educba.com/angular-vs-jquery/)

Comments :

I need to make some web pages more dynamic. The comparison angular vs jquery brings it to the point that jquery is a library good to make the javascript code of web pages simpler, smarter, but which should not be used if you rather need a complete framework like angular, to create a complete web application.

My current understanding is, it depends if you want to have a spring boot service with thymeleaf as html framework where jquery can improve the Javascript part or if you want to use angular instead.

[How to setup your Core Data OSX application](https://dev.mikamai.com/2015/07/01/how-to-setup-your-core-data-osx-application/)

Comments :

I admit, I am no fan of something so hard coupled as Core Data and it makes it even harder for me if I need to create an IOS application only to look into the Core Data coding.

My idea is to instead write an OSX application using Core Data.
