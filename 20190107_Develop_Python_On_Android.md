# 20190107 Develop Python On Android

I have started to learn Python.

When learning a new programming language it is always best to try out as much as you can while reading the documentation.

This time learning was fun, I managed to do both on my phone, reading the documentation and using my new knowledge.

This is how I did it :

1. install the Termux and in there you can install python, just type <code>python</code> and hit return, Termux will tell you how to get it
2. create softlinks to all common folders with <code>termux-setup-storage</code> as described [here](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Internal_and_external_storage)
3. install an editor, I use DroidEdit

Now you can create files with the editor in a directory reachable by both editor and Termux.

I have created the directory <code>pydemo</code> under <code>downloads</code> :

This is how the code looks in the editor :

Now you can execute your scripts using Python on your Android phone.
