20190316 Computer Language Comparison

Here I compare the language features of the languages I use or am learning right now.

I writing code in Groovy for some years now since Gradle is currently my main tool at work.

I have started looking into Python, because sometimes you really don't want to start Gradle, 
which can take some seconds and makes no sense for a script which needs 1 second for execution itself.

I am learning Kotlin and Swift at the moment with the aim to write Android and IOS apps.

I am writing down my findings as additional way to fix what I have learned and to help others.

I will not follow any order and please don't expect completeness.
