# 20200321 My MQTT Tooling And Setup

As server I use [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org).

I have one [installation on my Raspberry Pi](https://appcodelabs.com/introduction-to-iot-build-an-mqtt-server-using-raspberry-pi) for devices to connect at home
and one [windows installation on my Surface Go](https://mosquitto.org/download/) to be mobile. 

For testing the server and my client code I use [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com).
