## 20180729 My Blog Tools

I have started with another project on GitHub to get back the look-and-feel
of my old blog on [Wartbar.de](http://www.wartbar.de) : [blogtools](https://andrerolfs.github.io/blogtools.html))

Now I can create with a simple ```gradle createBlogPostIndex``` the file ```dailynoise.md```
which contains a list of links to my blogpost files.
