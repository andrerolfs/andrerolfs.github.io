# A GenericDatabase For CISystem

As mentioned I want to use a database for logging and data exchange in CISystem.

To access it from different computers I have started with a REST API using the Spring framework.

I am more than happy with using Spring Boot, this made it very easy to get the REST API running.

Till now I have only implemented a hello-world-demo, but this is only the beginning.
